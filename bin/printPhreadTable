SYNTAX:

 > $cmd [ASCII_BASE]


The program prints out the Phred or Q score values
for the range [0..42] corresponding to the range [33..75]
with the default ASCII_BASE = 33

NOTE: Old Illumina fastq uses ASCII_BASE = 64
};

my $TH = 33;

$TH = $ARGV[0] if ( defined $ARGV[0] && $ARGV[0] =~ m/^\d+$/ );

for ( my $i = 0 ; $i < 43 ; $i++ )
{
    print join( "\t",
        $i, sprintf( "%0.6f", 10**( -$i / 10 ) ),
        $i + $TH, chr( $i + $TH ) ),
      "\n";
}
